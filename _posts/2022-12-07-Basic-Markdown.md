Markdown is very easy to learn and write. It is broadly used in websites, notes, documents, etc. 

In this tutorial, we will go through some basic syntax of markdown to help you get started.

I strongly encourage you to take this [interactive tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) from Markdown Tutorial. 

## Styling Text
``` markdown
Surround text with 
_one_ * or _ to make it *italic*
__two__ * or _ to make it **bold**
___three___ * or _ to make it ***italic and bold***, or you can __*mix*__ and **_match_** it
~~two~~ ~ to ~~strikethrough~~ it
```

~~two~~ ~ to ~~strikethrough~~ it  

```
To make a horizontal line / section, use 3 - or * or _
I usually use 
<!-- This is comment which won't show up -->
---
to make a horizontal line

## Headings
```
# Heading is very easy
## Just add # in front of the text
### There are 6 levels of headings in total
#### The more # 
##### The smaller the heading
###### You got it!
