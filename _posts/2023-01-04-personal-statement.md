## 1. Why you’re interested in the subject

After being a data analyst for several interns and jobs, I explore more topics in data, and find myself more interested in data engineering. 

I realized that 
- my interest aligns more with data engineer than data analyst. 
- I like to prepare data and store them into formats that facilitate further usage more than analyzing them. 
- I like to make practical pipelines rather than building models based on hypothesis. 
- I like to make current process more efficient by creating automated systems.

I am interested in the full picture of data cycle, "how data works on the software side, how it’s processed, and how it ends up in an analytical layer."

I am also interested in automating monitoring, data management, data movement, and data quality checks.

Though I discover that I want to be a data engineer, I understand that I have to enforce my knowledge on some concepts, including computing, computer system, distributed systems, and architecture.
Therefore, want to study master of Computer Science.

## 2. Your enthusiasm for the subject:
### Projects I did
a holiday bucket list CRUD application with Flask and SQLAlchemy in Python
Overview of the project:
- get upcoming holidays using HKGOV API
- user can input items into bucket list which will be saved into database (SQLAlchemy)
- user can update and delete inputted items
- user can label items to specific holiday

Auto saving of Gmail attachments
make use of gmail API to save gmail attachments to desktop automatically

### Course Projects

**CSCI3170 Library system**
In the course of Introduction to database, we implemented an ordering system for a book store using Java and SQL in a team of three. 
First, we designed the data model based on given information of books, customers and orders using ER-diagram. We design a relational database with 5 tables, with 3 entities tables (book, customer and orders) and 2 relationship tables (ordering and book author)
Then, we built a Java command-line program which support interactive inquires from the customers and the book store staffs. For example, book searching, order creation, order update and popular book query.

**FTEC4003 Classification**
In this project, we used a real world dataset to predict whether holders of medical insurance of last year would be interested in car insurance. We used several methods including DecisionTree, KNN, Bayes, SVM, Adaboost and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree. Afterwards, we used f1 score to measure and found that the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree method had the best result, and the f1 score was around 0.7. During the process, we did data processing and tuned model parameters. At last, we got good grades with 19/20 points.

**FTEC4005 Recommender System**
In this project, we used a real world dataset to predict the ratings of different items for users. At first we used Item-item CF (Collaborative Filtering). In order to improve the performance, we added the Global Baseline, which also take user and item deviation in to consideration. At last, we got good grades with 18/20 points.

## 4. Relevant aspects of jobs, placements, work experience or volunteering:

### Job: Data analyst (Blue Cross)

**OCR:**
Extracted text (e.g. clinic name, doctor name, illness) from medical receipts using Python-tesseract, replacing manual processing of > 800 medical receipts per day 
Decided evaluation methods and computed similarity between receipts for validating medical receipts and detecting suspicious claims
Designed a new database to store OCR results of medical receipts and flags identifying suspicious claims

**Data ETL:**
Gathered user’s web & mobile app activity data via Mixpanel API 
Mapped user’s activity data with 4 production databases, which facilitated data integration for customer-based recommend system

**Recommender System:**
Improve the performance of a rule-based product recommendation engine by adding segment and users activity on web & mobile app 

**Website & Mobile App Analytics:**
A/B testing of dynamic banner (impressions, click-through rate, conversion rate) 
Build Mixpanel dashboards containing funnel reports and conversion rate from main page to payment page, group by business line and products for internal teams 

**Others:**
Enhance program security by encrypting config files 
Improve database performance by adding indexes

### Job: HKET
Used APIs to integrate email attachments into one dashboard to monitor daily performance 
Performed market analysis by comparing market data from AdMango with company data 
Generated reports using data from Google Ad Manager and Adform reports

### Work experience: Data Engineer Intern (Capital Crux)
**Data Pipeline - Finance data**
Gathered financial data (stock, cross rates, commodity, interest rates) from external data sources via API and web scraping from 5 websites 
Automated daily ingestion of financial data of > 100 securities using cron job which replaced manual scrapping of securities data 
Formatted and integrated the data into a single database for further analysis
